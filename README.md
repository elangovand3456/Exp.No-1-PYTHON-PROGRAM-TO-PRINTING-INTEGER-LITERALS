# Exp.No-1-PYTHON-PROGRAM-TO-PRINTING-INTEGER-LITERALS

### AIM
To write a python program to print the following integer literals 123,456,789

### ALGORITHM
Step 1:	Begin the program.
Step 2:	Initialize the integer literals 123, 456, and 789.
Step 3:	Use the print() function to display the numbers 123, 456, and 789.
Step 4:	Terminate the program.
### PROGRAM
num1 = 123
num2 = 456
num3 = 789
print(num1)
print(num2)
print(num3)
